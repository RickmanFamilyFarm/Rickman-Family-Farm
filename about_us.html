We had an idea for a non-GMO production in our town, helping growing our town in benefically ways.

        <p>For breakfast and lunch we let the free-ranged chickens eat the grass and the worms and all what comes with nature. Then when its dinner, they are fed with Organic Grower Crumbles bythe company Scratch & Peck. The store where we get all of our supplies, to feed and nurture them is the Country Store in Stanwood. </p>
